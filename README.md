# TAK A.I. G.U.I.:    Solving the party before it's even started.

Chiseled from the bedrock of primordial chaos by Tobias Akira

AI engine made by [Joshua Achiam](github.com/jachiam/tak-ai): If you lose, it's his fault.

Special thanks to the [LOVE game engine team](love2d.org), without whom you would probably still be playing an actually-entertaining game                        

### Installation
---
Linux: works
Mac: totally
Windows: oops
---

**Linux/Mac Install:** ```curl https://asgardiator.github.io/tak-ai-ghpage/ | sh```

**Windows Users:** Sorry, but until [torch](torch.ch) makes their library available for Windows,
you're going to have to sit tight. Alternatively, you can fight the AI using a
prettier interface on [playtak](playtak.com). You can also switch to [Ubuntu](ubuntu.com/download).

### People?
If you want to play against real people instead: [playtak.com](playtak.com)! 
They also have other, less difficult bots that you can fight.

### Community??
For only the finest bantz and advice on how to git gud: [Tak forums](reddit.com/r/tak)! 

### Freedom???
Finally, if you're a nerd who enjoys freedom, & you also make too much money, 
you can show your appreciaton with a bitcoin donation:

If it helps, try to imagine a puppy begging for kibbles. But instead of kibbles,
it's magic internet money that fights the system, then goes and starts its own
system, with blackjack and hookers.
